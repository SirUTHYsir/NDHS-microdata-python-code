# DHS 2018 Nigeria Microdata (Cleaned & Processed)

## Overview üìñ

This repository contains a cleaned and structured version of the **2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)** microdata, transformed into **CSV format** for ease of analysis. The dataset has been processed to focus on **child survival analysis** using time-to-event (survival) methods. It includes properly formatted variables, event indicators, and time variables consistent with survival analysis standards.


## File Contents üìÇ

* **raw_data/** ‚Üí Extracted original DHS raw files (.DAT/.SAV).
* **cleaned_data/** ‚Üí Final CSV files, ready for analysis.
* **code/** ‚Üí Scripts for cleaning, transformation, and exploratory checks (Python).
* **docs/** ‚Üí Metadata, dictionary, usage, methodology notes and many others.
* **summary/** ‚Üí Descriptive statistics and aggregated tables.

## Methods Note üõ†Ô∏è

The raw DHS birth recode files (BR) were transformed into a cleaned CSV using the following steps:

1. **Data Import & Selection** ‚Üí Selected relevant variables (child‚Äôs survival status, age at death, survey date, etc.).
2. **Event Definition** ‚Üí

   * `event = 1` ‚Üí Child died before the survey.
   * `event = 0` ‚Üí Child alive at the time of the survey.
3. **Time Variable Construction** ‚Üí

   * If `event = 1` ‚Üí `time = age at death in months (b7)`.
   * If `event = 0` ‚Üí `time = age at survey in months (b19)`.
   * If death occurred before 1 month ‚Üí coded as `time = 0`.
4. **Censoring & Cleaning** ‚Üí Alive cases are right-censored; implausible values removed.
5. **Export** ‚Üí Final dataset written to CSV with metadata dictionary.
